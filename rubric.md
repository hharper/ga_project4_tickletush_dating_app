## Functionality
Meets expectations. I think you did a great job with this application. Despite not having styles the heart and core of the functionality is sound. I'm really proud of you and the domain model you created to tackle this problem set. Now that the backend is primarily functional, the onus is on you to flesh this UI out and get in working the way you want!

## User Interface
Meets expectations. Although there isn't too much in the way of a an actual user interface, the routing is intuitive, and I imagine with even just an hour you could create a really nice backend only UI. I encourage you to maintain course on this project and finish the user facing materials!

## Code Quality / Maintainability
Meets Expectations. Your code looks clean and the separation of concerns is evident. I would really encourage you to comment on your code. Future haleigh will be much happier with you because she will have reference points for all of the code past haleigh created. Especially with all the complex logic happening in models/controllers. Also add some tests when you get a chance, employers love that stuff.


## Evidence of Comprehension
Meets Expectations ~ Exceeds Expectations. I can't really give you a solid exceeds expectations here due to a lack of JS and CSS which I can't guage your evidence of comprehension on. However, I will commend you for the logic contained within your controllers/models. This domain model is really cool. User auth and permissions was a very complex problem set you had to solve and you did so pretty elegantly. Great job. Moving forward I would definitely integrate a front end framework(maybe learn angular! or backbone! or react!) and some styles prior to the meet and hire so that you can wow potential employers.
